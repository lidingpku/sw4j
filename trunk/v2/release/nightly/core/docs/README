#summary the purpose of this open source code project and the organization of source code

= Introduction =
This project is designed to provide better JAVA APIs for semantic web programming.

 * author: [http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~dingl Li Ding]
 * license:MIT License
 * status:alpha
 * version:0.6
  


= Install =
general requirements
 * java 1.6.03  (1.5.12 may also work)

*core release*
 * use sw4j-core.jar. 
 * minimal java library dependency
 * some useful data structure and tools for semantic web programming
 * web crawling support

*full release*
 * use sw4j.jar
 * additional power for manipulate RDF, especially loading RDF
 * owl instance data validation
 * a couple of web service for normalize, diff, RDF data.

= code organization = 
The source code are partitioned into two directories
 * code-core  - the source code that requires minimal dependency on existing libraries
 * code-ext - the source code that is based on Jena, Pellet and other libraries.
 * files - the files for (i) unit test (ii) some output data (e.g. wiki dump generated by owl2wiki job)
 * docs - related documents

each directory consists the following 
 * src  - source code
 * src-test  - unit text code
 * lib - required library

== code-core ==
===required java library===
 * jena JAVA API. (we currently use jena-2.6.0)
 * GoogleSearch SOAP API. (Although deprecated by google, it is used to guess charset encoding.)
 * javacsv . - for csv data parsing
 * log4j. - for logging information
 * mysql connector - for access database

===code structure===
 sw4j.util - general purposed code  
 * sw4j.util - convenient data structure and computing functions 
 * sw4j.util.db - mysql database access functions 
 * sw4j.util.web - web data access functions 

 sw4j.task - carry specific data processing task
 * sw4j.task.common - shared code for task description and result report
 * sw4j.task.graph - process hypergraph and di-graph and graph search
 * sw4j.task.load -  loading data from the web, file, or string

== code-ext ==
===required java library===
 * core release requirements
 * Pellet (we currently use pellet 2 rc7)
 * Servlet. (we currently use pellet 2 rc7)
 * TDB . (we currently use tdb 0.8.2)

=== code structure ===
sw4j.rdf - rdf related code (based on jena)
 * sw4j.rdf.util  - shared functions sole dependent on jena
 * sw4j.rdf.pellet -  pellet dependent code
 * sw4j.rdf.tdb - tdb dependent code
 * sw4j.rdf.load - smartly parse RDF from documents, e.g. RDF/XML, RDFa, embedded RDF, gzipped RDF

sw4j.vocabulary - vocabularies for owl ontology
 * sw4j.vocabulary.pml - pml vocabulary
  
sw4j.app - applications
 * sw4j.app.job  - independent jobs 
 * sw4j.app.oie  - evaluate issues with owl instance data using referenced ontology
 * sw4j.app.servlet - a collection of web services
